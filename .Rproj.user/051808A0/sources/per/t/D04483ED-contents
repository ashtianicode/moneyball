loading the data
```{r}
baseball = read.csv("/Users/taha/Downloads/baseball.csv")

baseball


wins <- baseball$W

X <- baseball %>%
  select(-W)


colSums(is.na(X))

clean <-  na.omit(X)
clean

write.csv(x=clean, file="clean_baseball.csv")


# lowest p values =>  RankSeason, OOBP, RA, RS, Year, SLG

```



## variable selection and cleaning

first we fit the model and find pick the variables with lowest p values 
then we calculate a correlation matrix, and remove some of the highly correlated variables in order to avoid multicollinearity problem. 

"RankPlayoffs, RankSeason, OOBP, RA, RS, Year, SLG" are all significant variables. 
but since "RS"  "SLG" "OBP" are all highly correlated, we drop SLG as well. 


we end up with these variables for our model:
"RankPlayoffs, RankSeason, OOBP, RA, RS, Year"


```{r}

# picking lowest p vlaues
fit = lm(W~.,baseball)
anova(fit)
# lowest p values =>  RankSeason, OOBP, RA, RS, Year, SLG



# high correlations
numeric_vars <- baseball %>%
                  select(-Team,-League)

correlation_matrix <- cor(numeric_vars)
correlation_matrix
highlyCorrelated <- findCorrelation(correlation_matrix,cutoff=0.7)
colnames(numeric_vars[highlyCorrelated])
# [1] "RS"  "SLG" "OBP"


corrplot(correlation_matrix, method="circle")



```


fitting the model
```{r}


data <- baseball %>%
          select(-Team)



# reduced model
model_r <- lm(W~RankPlayoffs+ RankSeason+ OOBP+ RA+ RS+ Year, data=data )
summary(model_r)
anova(model_r)


# complete model
model_c <- lm(W~., data=data )
summary(model_c)
wanova(model_c)


df_complete = 12
df_drop = 12 - 6 
SSEreduced = 634.79
SSEcomplete = 595.16


MSEcomplete = SSEcomplete / df_complete
MSdrop = (SSEreduced - SSEcomplete) /df_drop

F_ts = MSdrop / MSEcomplete

p_value = pf(F_ts,6,101,lower.tail=F)

# p_value: 0.9917604
